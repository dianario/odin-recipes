    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This protein-packed soup requires little supervision, takes only a few minutes to prep, 
        and simmers away on the stove by itself until it's ready to be enjoyed! The recipe was extracted 
        from Pick Up Limes, an excellent resource for meat free diets. 
    </p>
    <p>We aways like to make a huge pot, and store batches in the freezer to enjoy later on. This serves
        4, takes only 5 min of prep and 25 min to cook. Perfect for a quick midweek dinner!
    </p>
