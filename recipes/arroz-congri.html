    <h1>Cuban Rice and Black Beans</h1>
    <img src="../img/rice-and-beans.jpg" alt="Cuban rice and beans served on a plate">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rice and black beans is a staple dish in Cuban households, and most Cuban Christmas Eve
        and New Year's eve celebrations will serve it, together with roasted pork.
        In spanish it is known as "Moros y Christianos" or "Arroz Congri". The word 
        <em>congri</em> originated in Haiti, as an amalgamation of the creole word for
        beans - <em>congo</em>, and the French word for rice - <em>riz</em>. 
    </p>
    <p>The name "Moros y Christianos" means Moors and Christians, and makes reference to
        the African Muslim governance (early 8th century) of the Iberian Peninsula and the
        subsequent Reconquista in the 15th century, in which Spanish Christians led by 
        wealthy families in the north of Spain forced the Moors from the south of Spain 
        into Africa. Moros refers to the black beans, and Cristianos to the white rice.
        It is also claimed that during the Cuban First Independence War (1868-1878), 
        some soldiers used to refer to the dish as "volunteers and bombers", alluding to 
        the fact that most war volunteers were white and most of the bombers were black.
